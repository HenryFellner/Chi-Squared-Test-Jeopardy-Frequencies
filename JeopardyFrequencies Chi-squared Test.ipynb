Splitting questions into individual words does not have the frequency required to draw conclusions on whether words are more or less common in high or low value questions. To draw better conclusions, terms should be broken into groups or phrases or categories, and have the frequency at which a word within that group appears be measured. In addition, the dataset should be expanded beyond the 20,000 rows used here."

To take this analysis further, in the future the words could be broken down into category. Looking at questions with a high-rate of overlap could get a sense of which questions are repeats. Some of these repeats should be manually investigated to see if they truly do or do not repeat. "
